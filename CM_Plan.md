# Git Process 


## Git flow

1.1 Master - actual branch without unfinished features, without experiments and trash. For every experiment - your own branch.

1.2 Every feature should be implenented in standalone branches. 
If you need some unfinished functional from other peoples or other branches - feel free to merge this branches without master branch.

1.3 When your feature was finished you should do pull text for code review and grant accept to merge you branch with master branch

1.4 Before merge you feature you should merge master into you finished branch and resolve all conflicts locally.
